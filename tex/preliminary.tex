\section{Preliminaries}
\label{preliminary}

\subsection{Notations}
In our problem, we consider a network modeled as a graph $G = (V,E)$, which represents a vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. For a source node $s$ and a target node $t$, we are interested in finding a path $p(s,t)=(s,v_1,v_2,...,v_{l-1},t)$ with a length of $|p(s,t)|$ close to the exact distance between $s$ and $t$ in the graph. Let $P(s,t)$ be the set of all paths from s to t. We can then define the distance between $s$ and $t$ as $d_G(s,t) = min_{p(s,t) \in P(s,t)}|p(s,t)|$.

We will focus on unweighted, undirected graphs in this paper. But all the ideas presented in this paper can be extended for weighted and/or directed graphs.

\subsection{Landmark based indexes}

Our method is motivated by the idea of using landmarks as the basis for indexes. Specifically, given a graph $G$ and a small (constant) set of landmarks $L$, $|L|$ BFS traversals are needed to compute shortest paths between each vertex in $G$ to each landmark in $L$. An index for the graph is constructed such that it contains a label $L(v)$ for each vertex. Each label store the shortest path to each landmark $(l_i, p(v,l_i))$ where $|p(v,l_i)| = d_G(v,l_i)$.

\subsection{The least common ancestor distance}

When shortest paths have been indexed, the common ancestors closest to the source and target can be derived from the labels. This common ancestor is called the least common ancestor $c_l(s,t)$ of the source and target vertex. Since the shortest-path distance satisfies the triangle inequality, for an arbitrary pair of vertices $s$ and $t$, we have the following bounds:

\begin{equation}
\label{equ:upper}
    d_G(s,t) \leq min_{l \in L}\{d_G(s,c_l(s,t)) + d_G(c_l(s,t),t)\}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:lower}
    d_G(s,t) \geq max_{l \in L}|d_G(s,c_l(s,t)) - d_G(c_l(s,t),t)|
\end{equation}

The upper bound, which we refer to LCA distance denoted by $d_{LCA}(s,t)$, can be used as an approximation of the distance of $s$ and $t$. Note that if $s$ and $t$ are not connected with each other, there will not be a common $l$ from $L(s)$ and $L(t)$.
