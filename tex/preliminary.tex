%\subsection{Notations}
In our problem, we consider a graph $G = (V,E)$. For a source node $s$ and a target node $t$, we are interested in finding a path $p(s,t)=(s,v_1,v_2,...,t)$ with a length of $|p(s,t)|$ close to the exact distance between $s$ and $t$. Let $P(s,t)$ be the set of all paths from $s$ to $t$. The distance between $s$ and $t$ is $d_G(s,t) = min_{p(s,t) \in P(s,t)}|p(s,t)|$. We focus on unweighted, undirected graphs in this paper.

%\subsection{Landmark based indexes}

Our method is motivated by the idea of using landmarks as the basis for indexes. Specifically, given a graph $G$ and a set of $k$ landmarks $(l_1,l_2,...,l_k)$, an index contains a label $L(v)$ for each vertex which store the shortest path to each landmark. The label can be constructed by building a shortest path tree $SPT$ from each landmark.

%\subsection{The least common ancestor distance}

The least common ancestor of two vertex in a tree is the furthest ancestor from the root, we denote it as $LCA(s,t)$. The shortest path distance satisfies the triangle inequality, for an arbitrary pair of vertices $s$ and $t$, the following bound holds:
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:upper}
    d_G(s,t) \leq min_{l}\{d_G(s,LCA_{l}(s,t)) + d_G(LCA_{l}(s,t),t)\}
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{equ:lower}
    %d_G(s,t) \geq max_{l \in L}|d_G(s,c_l(s,t)) - d_G(c_l(s,t),t)|
%\end{equation}
This upper bound, which is referred to as LCA distance and denoted by $d_{LCA}(s,t)$, can be used as an approximation of the distance from $s$ and $t$. We denote the path indicated by this distance as $p_{LCA}(s,t)$.
