\begin{abstract}

Point-to-point shortest path/distance problem is building blocks for numerous applications. Solving this problem efficiently for large-scale complex networks is challenging. For complex networks with at least millions of vertices, classical BFS/Dijkstra traversal is too expensive to use. In this review, we provide a comprehensive state-of-the-art study in which we thoroughly expose the main focus of shortest path/distance algorithms in large-scale complex networks and network structures that inspired these algorithms as well as limitations of existing works.
