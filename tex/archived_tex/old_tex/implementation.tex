\subsection{Implementation Overview}

We implemented all methods including the classical Dijkstra's online shortest path algorithm and our proposed methods within the SNAP framework, a recently proposed high-performance graph processing engine for handling graph related computational tasks. The reason that we choose SNAP is that it has great ability to store and process large scale graphs in a highly efficient manner. We next give an overview of the SNAP architecture.
