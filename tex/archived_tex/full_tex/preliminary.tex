\section{Preliminaries}
\label{preliminary}

In our problem, we consider a graph $G = (V,E)$. For a source node $s$ and a target node $t$, we are interested in finding a path $p(s,t)=(s,v_1,v_2,...,t)$ with a length of $|p(s,t)|$ close to the exact distance $d_G(s,t)$ between $s$ and $t$. We focus on unweighted, undirected graphs in this paper.

Our method is motivated by the idea of using landmarks as the basis for indexes. Specifically, given a graph $G$ and a set of $k$ landmarks $(l_1,l_2,...,l_k)$, an index contains a label $L(v)$ for each vertex that stores the shortest path to each landmark. The label can be constructed by building a shortest path tree $SPT$ using BFS from each landmark.

The least common ancestor of two vertices in a tree is the farthest ancestor from the root, which we denote as $LCA(s,t)$. The shortest distance satisfies the triangle inequality, i.e., for an arbitrary pair of vertices $s$ and $t$, the following bound holds:
\begin{equation}
\label{equ:upper}
    d_G(s,t) \leq min_{l}\{d_G(s,LCA_{l}(s,t)) + d_G(LCA_{l}(s,t),t)\}
\end{equation}
This upper bound, which is referred to as the LCA distance and denoted by $d_{LCA}(s,t)$, can be used as an approximation of the distance from $s$ and $t$. We denote the path indicated by this distance as $p_{LCA}(s,t)$. The LCA distance and related path for a specific landmark $l$ is denoted as $d_{LCA_l}(s,t)$ and $p_{LCA_l}(s,t)$ respectively.
