\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this paper, we describe a novel method to combine online and offline processing to allow approximate shortest path for extremely large graphs with high distance accuracy, path diversity and low overhead. 
%We demonstrate that different accuracy and overhead levels can be achieved by controlling the search space. 
We also develop an effective heuristic approach for constructing indexes that can improve the accuracy without increasing overhead. We implement our algorithm for cloud computing graph processing platforms, and demonstrate that our system can handle extremely large graphs and achieve high query processing throughput. The scalability of our system is good as both the number of machines and the number of parallel processed queries increases.
