% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement

%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}

Finding approximate shortest paths for extremely large-scale complex graphs is still a challenging problem, where existing work requires too much overhead to achieve accurate results for graphs with hundreds of millions or even billions of edges. In this paper, we develop a decentralized search method based on preprocessed indexes, to approximate shortest path of arbitrary pairs of vertices. We demonstrate that the algorithm achieves very high accuracy with much less index overhead compared to previous work. The algorithm can also achieve differentiated level of accuracies by dynamically controlling the search space to meet various application needs. In order to perform decentralized search more efficiently, we propose a new heuristic index construction algorithm that can greatly increase the approximation accuracy. We further develop support for parallel searches to further reduce the average search time. We implement our algorithm in distributed settings to deal with extreme size graphs. Our algorithm can handle graphs with billions of edges and perform searches for millions of queries in parallel. We evaluate our algorithm on various real world graphs from different disciplines with at least millions of edges.
