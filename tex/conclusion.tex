\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this paper, we describe a novel method to combine online and offline processing to allow approximate searches for extremely large graphs with high accuracy and low overhead. We demonstrate that different accuracy and overhead levels can be achieved by various optimizations controlling the search space of decentralized searches. We also propose a more effective heuristic approach for constructing indexes of the network that can improve the accuracy of the decentralized search without increasing preprocessing and online searching overhead. We implement our algorithm for cloud computing graph processing platforms, and demonstrate that our system can handle extremely large graphs and processing millions of queries in parallel.
