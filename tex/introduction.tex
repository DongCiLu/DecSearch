\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

Various types of graphs are commonly used as models for real-world phenomenon, such as online social networks, biological networks, the world wide web, among others~\cite{newman2010networks}. As their sizes keep increasing, scaling up algorithms to handle extreme size graphs with billions of vertices and edges remains a challenge that has drawn increased attention in recent years. Specifically, straightforward operations in graph theory are usually too slow or costly when they are applied to graphs at this scale. One problem is finding shortest paths in the network, an operation that serves as the building block for many other tasks. For example, a natural application for road network is providing driving directions~\cite{Abraham:2011:HLA:2008623.2008645}. In social networks, such applications include social sensitive search~\cite{Vieira:2007:ESR:1321440.1321520}, analyzing influential people~\cite{Kempe:2003:MSI:956750.956769}, among others. Estimating minimum round trip time between hosts without direct measurement is another application in technology networks~\cite{Tang:2003:VLI:948205.948223}.

Although previous works have studied the shortest path problem on large road networks extensively and have very effective approaches, a large category of networks known as the complex networks has very different structures. Approaches that worked on road networks do not perform well on complex networks, as the latter follow power law degree distributions and exhibit small diameters. In this paper, we focus on the shortest path problem for complex networks in particular, as their extreme sizes and unique topologies make the problem particularly challenging.

Our design is motivated by recent studies that combine both offline processing and online queries~\cite{Potamias:2009:FSP:1645953.1646063, tretyakov2011fast, Akiba:2012:SQC:2247596.2247614, 6399472, Jin:2012:HLA:2213836.2213887}. In these methods, the step of preprocessing aims to construct indexes for the networks, which are later used in the online query phase to dramatically reduce the query time. Among these approaches, landmark based algorithms~\cite{Thorup:2005:ADO:1044731.1044732, Goldberg:2005:CSP:1070432.1070455, Potamias:2009:FSP:1645953.1646063, Gubichev:2010:FAE:1871437.1871503, tretyakov2011fast, 6399472}are widely used for approximate shortest path/distance between vertices. Such algorithms select a small set of landmarks, and construct an index that consists of labels for each vertex, that store distances or shortest paths to landmarks. The approximation accuracy of landmark based algorithms heavily depends on the number of landmarks. To achieve high accuracy, a relatively large set of landmarks is required, which lead to large preprocessing overheads. Indexes that can answer path queries usually have much larger space overhead than indexes that can only answer distance queries. One goal of our design, therefore, is to provide accurate results while still maintain low overhead for indexing.

Previous works only apply online search to explore short cuts between labels of source and target vertices for indexed graphs~\cite{Gubichev:2010:FAE:1871437.1871503, 6399472}. The accuracy and diversity of approximated path are rather limited this way, e.g. the approximated path only consist vertices contained in both labels. To overcome this problem, we propose to performs a heuristic search over the indexed graph. The search is guided by locally collected information from labels of nearby vertices. The advantage is that the search can expand the search space into edges that have not been indexed to achieve higher accuracy and diversity of approximated path with limited index size. The heuristic search that we use is called decentralized search which was introduced in~\cite{Kleinberg:2000p5066, kleinberg2006complex}. Here the "`decentralized"' means that the decision of the search is made based solely on local information which, in our context, is the labels of neighbor vertices at each step of the search.

Decentralized search is very light weighted. The number of visited vertices for decentralized search is bounded by the diameter of the network. Considering that complex networks have relatively a short diameter, decentralized search can finish in limited number of steps. The search can also adjust its search space to balance between different level of performance and required resources for each search. The search is very versatile to meet various application needs without redoing the preprocessing.  

The performance of decentralized search relies heavily on the index. To achieve better accuracy without increasing index overhead, we introduce a heuristic index construction algorithm to control shortest paths to be indexed during preprocessing. The propose approach outperforms random shortest path indexing by large margin on real networks.

We implement decentralized search on a distributed platform to support large scale graph with billions of edges. To take advantage of resources available for a cluster of machines, our algorithm can support large amount of queries to run in parallel. There are two properties of decentralized search which makes it very suitable for parallel processing. First, decentralized search has small space complexity and communication complexity. The search does not need to store any information on a per vertex basis like BFS or A* search, very limited space overhead is required for each search. Second, decentralized search only have $RAR$ data dependency on the index and underlying graph. Multiple searches can run independently on the same graph and index. These properties makes it possible for a large number of searches running in parallel efficiently without reaching the physical limit of machines, i.e. memory size or network bandwidth. For example, in our experiments, we show that millions of decentralized search can run in parallel on graphs with billions of edges on a cluster of commodity machines, and finish in tens of seconds. 

Based on our algorithm design, we further develop a query-processing system based on distributed cloud infrastructure. In this platform, users first submit their graphs for preprocessing needs. The graph processing engine will assign resources according to application's need for accuracy and construct an index for the input graph. Later, users may submit large volumes of queries repeatedly, for which responses will be generated. The light-weighted decentralized search allows a large number of queries to run in parallel so that queries can be answered in a timely manner. Applications that generate queries (on the client side) can provide their desired accuracy levels and the graph processing engine can dynamically adjust search space of decentralized search to meet differentiated levels of accuracies.
